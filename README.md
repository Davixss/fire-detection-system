# Overview
In recent years, the rapid development of technologies for the Internet of
Things (IoT) and distributed systems has led to a significant evolution in
the field of smart cities. In this context, the integration of intelligent and
automated solutions is revolutionising urban infrastructure management,
offering new opportunities to improve the safety, efficiency and quality of
life of citizens.
The project presented is placed in this scenario and aims to simulate a
solution for emergency management in urban areas, with particular at-
tention to the detection and management of risk situations. Through the
adoption of advanced technologies, such as reliable communication pro-
tocols, containerised infrastructures and distributed architectures, it has
been possible to create a scalable system adaptable to the modern needs
of smart cities.
